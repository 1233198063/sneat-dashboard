# Quick Start Guide - Email Page with Mock Data

## 🚀 Current Status: WORKING!

The email page is now fully functional with mock data from MySQL-like structure. You can see real email data including names, avatars, messages, and timestamps.

## 🔧 What's Running

- **Backend**: Running on `http://localhost:5000` with mock email data
- **Email API**: Working at `http://localhost:5000/api/emails`
- **Sample Data**: 5 mock emails with different statuses (pending, sent, failed)

## 📧 Test the API

You can test the email API directly:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/emails"
```

## 🎯 What You See

The email page now displays:
- **Real Data**: Names, email addresses, subjects, messages
- **Avatars**: Some users have placeholder images, others get auto-generated letter avatars
- **Status Indicators**: Different colors for pending (blue), failed (red), sent emails
- **Timestamps**: Shows creation time formatted as "11:46 PM" or "Jan 17"
- **Pagination**: For handling multiple emails
- **Folder Filtering**: Inbox (pending), Sent (sent), Spam (failed)

## 📊 Sample Data Included

The mock database contains:
1. **John Doe** - Product Inquiry (pending)
2. **Jane Smith** - Business Collaboration (sent)
3. **Mike Johnson** - Technical Support (pending)
4. **Sarah Wilson** - Order Update (failed)
5. **David Brown** - Account Information (pending)

## 🔄 Next Steps for Real MySQL

When you're ready to use real MySQL:

1. **Install MySQL** on your system
2. **Update environment variables** in `service/.env`
3. **Run database initialization**:
   ```bash
   cd service
   mysql -u root -p < database/init.sql
   ```
4. **Switch to real MySQL routes** in `service/app.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Change this line:
   const emailRoutes = require('./routes/email-mock');
   // To this:
   const emailRoutes = require('./routes/email');
   ```

## 🌐 Frontend Features

## 🔍 How to View

1. Start the backend (already running): `cd service && npm start`
